# Greedy-Algorithms
Greedy algorithms build solutions step by step, making locally optimal choices at each stage. 
The Fractional Knapsack problem follows this approach by selecting items based on the highest value-to-weight ratio, allowing fractional selection to maximize total value. 
Unlike its 0/1 Knapsack counterpart, which requires dynamic programming, the fractional variant provides an optimal solution in O(nlogn) time using sorting.
